# RCM Risk Mitigator Pipeline

## Project Overview

In the healthcare industry, **Accounts Receivable (AR)** plays a critical role in determining the financial health of hospitals and clinics. When AR goes uncollected â€” especially past **90 days**, it can significantly disrupt cash flow and impact patient services.

> Industry statistics:
> - 93.4% collected within 30 days  
> - 85.2% within 60 days  
> - Only 73.1% within 90 days

To mitigate this risk, healthcare providers need real-time insights into AR metrics and other **Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)** KPIs.

---

## Solution

This project delivers an **end-to-end cloud-based data pipeline** to monitor and analyze RCM metrics like:

- **Accounts Receivable (AR)** aging
- **Days in AR**
- **Net Collection Rate**
- **Claim acceptance and denial trends**
- **Provider payment performance**

The pipeline is built using **Medallion Architecture** (Landing â†’ Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold), ensuring **data quality, scalability**, and **reliability**.

---

## Architecture & Workflow

### **Medallion Architecture Breakdown:**

- **Landing Layer**  
  Raw flat files from APIs, Azure SQL, and other external sources.

- **Bronze Layer**  
  Data ingestion using **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** into **ADLS Gen2**.

- **Silver Layer**  
  Transformations in **Azure Databricks (PySpark)**:
  - Schema unification
  - SCD2 for patient records
  - Data quality checks (nulls, type mismatch)
  - Metadata logging

- **Gold Layer**  
  Analytical **Fact/Dim models** for KPIs and dashboards.

### Key Features

- **Metadata-driven** design with external configuration files
- **Supports full & incremental loads** via parameterization
- **Retry & timeout logic** for pipeline robustness
- **Toggle components on/off** dynamically with config flags

## Strategic Impact

By identifying revenue leaks early and tracking AR aging effectively, healthcare providers can:
- Boost cash flow with faster collections
- Reduce claim denials through proactive analysis
- Identify and empower high-performing providers
- Optimize billing and follow-up workflows for better patient engagement
