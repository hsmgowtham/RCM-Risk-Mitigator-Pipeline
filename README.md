# RCM Risk Mitigator Pipeline

## Project Overview

In the healthcare industry, **Accounts Receivable (AR)** plays a critical role in determining the financial health of hospitals and clinics. When AR goes uncollected â€” especially past **90 days**, it can significantly disrupt cash flow and impact patient services.

> Industry statistics:
> - 93.4% collected within 30 days  
> - 85.2% within 60 days  
> - Only 73.1% within 90 days

To mitigate this risk, healthcare providers need real-time insights into AR metrics and other **Revenue Cycle Management (RCM)** KPIs.

---

## Solution

This project delivers an **end-to-end cloud-based data pipeline** to monitor and analyze RCM metrics like:

- **Accounts Receivable (AR)** aging
- **Days in AR**
- **Net Collection Rate**
- **Claim acceptance and denial trends**
- **Provider payment performance**

The pipeline is built using **Medallion Architecture** (Landing â†’ Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold), ensuring **data quality, scalability**, and **reliability**.

---

## Architecture & Workflow

### **Medallion Architecture Breakdown:**

- **Landing Layer**  
  Raw flat files from APIs, Azure SQL, and other external sources.

- **Bronze Layer**  
  Data ingestion using **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** into **ADLS Gen2**.

- **Silver Layer**  
  Transformations in **Azure Databricks (PySpark)**:
  - Schema unification
  - SCD2 Implementation
  - Data quality checks (nulls, type mismatch)
  - Metadata logging

- **Gold Layer**  
  Analytical **Fact/Dim models** for KPIs and dashboards.

### Sources
**API's**
1. International classification of Diseases (ICD) Code API - This API contains columns like ICD Code, Description, Category, and Diagnosis Type, etc.
2. National Provider Identifier API - This API contains columns like NPI ID, First Name, Last Name, Position, Organisation Name, Last Updated, and Refreshed At, etc.

**Landing File Drops**
1. Hospital_Claim.csv - The file includes important columns such as ClaimID, PatientID, ProviderID, ServiceDate, ClaimAmount, PaidAmount, ClaimStatus, and PayorType, which capture essential details about claims, payments, and claim status in the healthcare process.
2. CPT_Code.csv - Current Procedural Terminology, a standardized system used to code and describe medical, surgical, and diagnostic services and procedures.
The file includes key columns such as Procedure Code Category, CPT Codes, Procedure Code Descriptions, and Code Status, which provide details about medical procedures, their codes, descriptions, and status.

**Azure SQL DB**
1. Patients - Patient Information
2. Encounters - Patient encounter with provider information (encounter type, date, providerid, department_id, etc.)
3. Providers - Provider Information (general information, department, specilization, etc.)
4. Departments - Department Informtion
5. Transactions - Transaction made by patient for services received (id, type, servicedate, provider, visittype, amount, amountype, claim, etc.)

## Strategic Impact

By identifying revenue leaks early and tracking AR aging effectively, healthcare providers can:
- Boost cash flow with faster collections
- Reduce claim denials through proactive analysis
- Identify and empower high-performing providers
- Optimize billing and follow-up workflows for better patient engagement
